# flappy-bird-console-python
Self-explanatory. It's flappy bird in the cmd or terminal when your bored and have nothing to do, and you jump by pressing f. You die if you touch anything and the physics is wonky so it was hard to code in (The terminal velocity was somehow 1). Anyway enjoy!!
p.s. run main.py
